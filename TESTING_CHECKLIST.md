## 🧪 Admin Booking Improvements Smoke Test (March 7, 2026)

Scope tested against local API:
- `GET /api/admin/users`
- `POST /api/admin/users`
- `POST /api/admin/bookings` strict `userId` requirement
- Enforced admin create status behavior (`CONFIRMED` + `PAID`)
- Overlap conflict rejection

Results:
- [x] Admin login works (`admin@jamroom.com`)
- [x] Admin users list API returns results
- [x] Admin can create user inline (temp password `Qwerty123` from API response)
- [x] Duplicate admin-created user is rejected (`400`)
- [x] Admin booking create without `userId` is rejected (`400`)
- [x] Admin booking create stores `bookingStatus=CONFIRMED` and `paymentStatus=PAID`
- [x] Overlapping booking is rejected (`400`)

Notes:
- First forced-status test attempt failed due an already-occupied slot in the chosen time range.
- Re-ran with unique user/date/time and confirmed forced status behavior passes.
- Script used: `admin_booking_smoke_test.ps1`

Pending manual UI verification:
- [x] Typeahead user picker behavior in Create Booking modal
- [x] Inline `+ Add User` modal UX from admin page
- [x] Modal reset behavior after successful booking create
- [x] Visual parity checks for per-day/in-house rental interactions in admin modal

Live UI verification notes:
- Created user from admin modal and auto-selected in booking form.
- Submitted booking with mixed in-house/per-day selections and verified booking row showed `CONFIRMED` with expected rental lines.
- Confirmed post-create table refresh and stats update happened without page reload.

## 🧪 Payment + Mobile Compatibility Smoke Test (March 2026)

### UPI Flow Compatibility
- [ ] `Open UPI App` launches using universal `upi://pay` link
- [ ] `Share Payment Link` opens native share sheet (or falls back cleanly)
- [ ] `Copy UPI Link` copies full UPI URI successfully
- [ ] `Copy UPI ID` copies VPA successfully
- [ ] No dependence on app-specific deep links (`phonepe://`, `tez://`, etc.)

### UPI Layout Resilience (Mobile)
- [ ] Long UPI IDs wrap fully inside card (no clipping)
- [ ] QR frame remains inside the UPI card on narrow screens
- [ ] UPI action buttons stack correctly on mobile

### Mobile Booking Behavior
- [ ] `/booking.html` works directly on phone viewports (no shell redirect dependency)
- [ ] Hourly/per-day toggle does not cause horizontal page overflow on mobile
- [ ] `New Booking` and `My Bookings` sections remain reachable and readable at <=480px
- [ ] Booking action controls remain tap-friendly on small screens
- [ ] PWA install prompt appears where supported

### Admin Workflow Regression Checks
- [ ] Send eBill supports customer + additional emails in one action
- [ ] Invalid additional recipient email is rejected with validation message
- [ ] Admin edit booking with item-level rentals recalculates totals server-side
- [ ] Manage Bookings uses backend pagination/search/sort (not client-only slicing)
- [ ] Changing page size or page index triggers fresh backend fetch and updates metadata
- [ ] Admin can update existing user details (`name/email/mobile`) from Users tab

- [ ] Price: ₹50 × quantity × duration
- [ ] 3 IEMs, 2h = ₹300 total

#### **In-house vs Per-day Logic**
- [ ] Guitar (In-house): No +/- buttons, shows "Tied to JamRoom duration"
- [ ] Guitar (Per-day): Has +/- buttons, shows "₹800/day"

- [ ] Mics: FREE
- [ ] Guitar: ₹400 (200×2)
- [ ] IEM: ₹100 (50×1×2)
- [ ] **Expected Total**: ₹1,100 + GST

#### **Scenario 2: Mixed Rental Types**
JamRoom (1h) + Keyboard Per-day + 3 IEMs
- [ ] JamRoom: ₹300 (300×1)
- [ ] Keyboard: ₹800 (flat rate)
- [ ] IEMs: ₹150 (50×3×1)
- [ ] **Expected Total**: ₹1,250 + GST

### ⚡ **Real-time Updates**
- [ ] Change duration from 1h→3h: in-house items update automatically
